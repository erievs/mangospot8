# Things to Know #

- Before making an issue PLEASE read this.

- You probbaly need Premium, I am almost 100% sure. You can try it just don't complain to me if it doesn't work. It depends on the web apis for spotify.

- MangoSpot WinRT is what I now called the orginal build of MangoSpot which only supports Windows 8.1, of course this isn't what it was called at launch.

- Just like with MangoSpot WiRT, songs are fetched from YouTube, filtered for the best result, in MangoSpot8 Beta 1.1.0 we will switch to using YouTube music API and user agent, which will improve it even more.
However, it is pretty good of course they will be a couple of missed songs or not 100% the right version, but beats only 30 seconds of audio, and again will be better as the updates go one. 

- Darkmode will be coming soon.

- The UI can be a bit jank (sorry).

- Position doesn't recover when exiting app (easy fix will be in Beta 1.1.0)

- Not everything is done yet, sorry that liking songs and playlists are not in just yet (you can view them of course!).

- No auto play or skiping songs in a playlist for now, dont worry however this will be in Beta 1.1.0, the next update (unless there is A MAJOR issue).

- Please report bugs in issues not ONLY on a discord server.

- Please don't have a list of a feature requsts, make one 'issue' for each, and please do not go overboard in feature requsts (I am not going to add TV playback or whatever THAT WOULD BE A LOT OF WORK AND LIKE IDK IF IT IS EVEN POSSIBLE).

- This is a hobby project, I may refuse to repsond to support requsts, I have to say this because this has happened before but if you keep calling me on discord (I never call anyone I don't know IRL on discord) or annoy me I will be pissed off at you, I do not get paid, I like what I like don't arugue about colours or else I will force piss mode.

- I go by NCP,NCP3.0,Erie Valley Software,ErieVS.

- Why Mango, because of Windows Phone 7.5 someone a discord server suggseted it (yes I know this doesn't 7.5 but I like the name).

- Will there be a 7.5 build or 7, maybe if I can figure out how to jailbreak by titan (if someone can help I'll do it).

- Will there be a real UWP version, maybe idk.

- I don't have a discord server but I hang out and talk about MangoTube on multiple Windows Phone realated server some more than other.

- If you live in Russia or Belarus you're probably screwed sorry not much I can do for you maybe. I'm not really going to be able to offer support to y'all because it's more than likely a geo blocking thing or something network related and I don't live there not much I can do. Try a VPN or Proxy I guess.

- Please avoid saying "fix blank" network related thing, instead connect to visual studio and run/build the MangoSpot8 project and give me the output. I am sadly not a network reader so I cannot really do much, if you can figure out a way to reproduce it reliably then tell me and I can do it myself.

# Dependencies #

Should all be included (for now) as of Beta 1.0.1 .
